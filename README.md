# Tesla-Production-Test-Engineering
Projects to showcase for my Tesla interview.

The following has been accomplished so far - 
- Using tinyGO (go compiler for arduino) to make an LED blink
- Startled learning libplctag to program PLC's using GoLang
- Started looking at communication protocols, specifically PySerial
